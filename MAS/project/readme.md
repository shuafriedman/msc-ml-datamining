The provided code implements a Q-learning agent for a two-player game environment, specifically designed for characters named Mario and Bowser. This agent is part of a reinforcement learning system that learns to make decisions—selecting actions to maximize future rewards—based on interactions with the game environment. Here's an overview of the overall code structure and functionality:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**: The agent is initialized with key parameters and structures for learning, including the game environment, the player it controls (Mario or Bowser), learning rate (`alpha`), discount factor (`gamma`), exploration rate (`epsilon`), and dictionaries for storing Q-values and optimal strategies.

2. **Training (`train`)**: The agent undergoes training over a specified number of episodes. Each episode is a complete run of the game from start to end (or until a terminal state is reached), during which the agent interacts with the environment to learn from the outcomes of its actions.

3. **Gameplay Simulation (`play_game`)**: Simulates a game episode, where the agent and its opponent take turns performing actions based on the current game state. The agent selects actions using either an exploration strategy (random choice) or an exploitation strategy (choosing the action with the highest Q-value), depending on the exploration rate (`epsilon`). The opponent's actions are chosen randomly for simplicity.

4. **Action Selection (`choose_action` and `choose_opponent_action`)**: These methods determine the actions to be taken by the agent and its opponent, respectively. The agent's action is chosen based on an ε-greedy policy, which balances between exploring new actions and exploiting the known best actions.

5. **Q-value Update (`update_q_values`)**: After each action, the agent updates its Q-values based on the received reward and the estimated future rewards, using the Temporal Difference (TD) learning formula. This update process refines the agent's strategy over time, aiming to maximize total rewards.

6. **Optimal Strategy Determination (`determine_optimal_strategies`)**: Post-training, the agent analyzes its learned Q-values to determine the optimal action for each encountered state, which are then stored in `optimal_strategies`.

7. **Random Strategy Utility (`get_random_strategy`)**: A helper function used for selecting a random action from the set of legal actions in the current state, primarily for exploration purposes.

8. **Optimal Strategies Output (`print_optimal_strategies`)**: This method prints the optimal action for each state as determined by the agent, useful for debugging and analysis of the learned strategies.

Overall, this code represents a Q-learning-based approach to developing an autonomous agent capable of learning optimal gameplay strategies through repeated interactions with a two-player game environment. The agent aims to learn from both the successes and failures of its actions, adjusting its strategy to improve performance over time.
